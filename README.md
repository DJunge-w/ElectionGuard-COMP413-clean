## ‚ùì What Is End-to-End Verifiable Encryption?
 In general, E2E encryption is a way to guarantee voting system security, which prevents someone other than the sender or recipient from accessing & modifying the ballots. That means, the voters first vote the way they would traditionally on an electronic voting system, but in the end, an e2e system could use some fancy cryptographic method and generate a receipt of a long sequence of numbers or a qrcode. This receipt is essentially a computer record of the vote that's been encrypted with a secret key the voter doesn't have. But it still allows voters to verify that their votes were counted. They can take the encrypted ballots that were published and write up a mathematical proof which shows that the ballots add up to the officially announced totals.  That is the mechanism of how the voters can get confident evidence of their ballot being effective without revealing which candidates were voted for nor requiring them to trust election official results, software, hardware, and so on.


## ‚ùì What Is ElectionGuard?
ElectionGuard is an open source software development kit (SDK) that makes voting more secure, transparent and accessible. The ElectionGuard SDK leverages homomorphic encryption to ensure that votes recorded by electronic systems of any type remain encrypted, secure, and secret. Meanwhile, ElectionGuard also allows verifiable and accurate tallying of ballots by any 3rd party organization without compromising secrecy or security.

## ‚ùóÔ∏èHere comes Electionguard Typescript!
Our team focuses on building a bridge between the vote-by-mail system and end-to-end verifiable encryption. We want to create a user-friendly web application that not only allows user to vote and print out their ballot, but also performs chaum Peterson encryption while they are voting. This is actually an in-browser version of election guard. 

To achieve this, for Microsoft team, we built a typescript frontend implementation that uses the exactly same encryption logic as election guard. For Front end web interface, we built a fully encapsulated API to add the feature of ballot encryption for them. You can just use approximately few lines of code that calls encrpt_ballot in the front-end typescript, and we will handle everything else for you.

## üíª Requirements

- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is <ins>**required**</ins> to develop this SDK. If developer uses multiple versions of python, [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is suggested to assist version management.
- [Typescript 4.2](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download) is used to perform script written for front-end web applciation. 
- [Node & Yarn Package Management](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) is used to install all dependencies used for ballot encryption. 
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) is used to simplify the commands and GitHub Actions. This approach is recommended to simplify the command line experience. This is built in for MacOS and Linux. For Windows, setup is simpler with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) and installing the provided [make package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/make). The other Windows option is [manually installing make](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm).
- [Gmpy2](https://gmpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used for [Arbitrary-precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) which
  has its own [installation requirements (native C libraries)](https://gmpy2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installation) on Linux and MacOS. **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** _This is not required for Windows since the gmpy2 precompiled libraries are provided._
- [poetry 1.1.10](https://python-poetry.org/) is used to configure the python environment. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).


## Impact

This is not just a simple school project that will be left out once the semester is over. Our project has profound significance: 
1. We helped add an in-browser implementation to Microsoft Electoinguard, which widens the area where Electionguard can be used. Now Electionguard can also be used in-browser to provide secure, verifiable end-to-end encryption for vote-by-mail systems.

2. Out project is already used as a library by an online vote-by-mail system named Enhanced Voting. We had worked together with Enhanced Voting throughout the semester to integrate our in-browser Electionguard with their voting system. So our project will actually benefit a lot of vote-by-mail voters in making sure that their ballots are secure and verifiable just like any other voters who vote in person.

3. The test factory we built is generic enough to be used across different implementations of Electionguard. As you can imagine, there are also implementations of Electionguard in other languages. Our test factory will help them ensure their compatibility with Microsoft‚Äôs python version. 

Therefore, this is a project that has already benefited and will continue to benefit multiple parties. We are really glad to work on a project that has such a long-lasting impact during this semester. Hope you‚Äôve enjoyed our presentation and thank you for listening. 

## Robustness & Compatibility

Testing is always important in any engineering project. How do we know that our implementation is correct? 

Since we‚Äôre branching out from Microsoft‚Äôs python version, there‚Äôs one more thing we need to worry about: whether our version is compatible with Microsoft‚Äôs. That is to say, given the same inputs, we should come up with the exact same outputs as Microsoft‚Äôs version. To test that our version is correct, we‚Äôve unit-tested each sub-pieces of our implementation. 

To make sure that our version is compatible with Microsoft‚Äôs, we built a test factory that contained input-output pairs generated from Microsoft‚Äôs version and used this [test factory](testVector.sh) to test against our version. Once we ensured that the test factory‚Äôs inputs resulted in the same outputs under our typescript version, we were confident that our implementation is compatible with Microsoft‚Äôs.
